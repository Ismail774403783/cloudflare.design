    <h1>Product Writing Guidelines</h1>
    <p>Like any of our content, product content reflects our brand voice. Product content also serves user interfaces. These guidelines uphold Cloudflare’s voice and emphasize ease-of-use within our products.</p>
    <p>The tone we use varies based on what customers want and feel while using certain products and features.</p>
    <p>[not in order of importance yet]</p>
    <h3><strong>Be Concise</strong>[maps to Transparent]</h3>
    <p>Respect our customers’ time. Get to the point, so they can get to what they need. Edit ruthlessly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep sentences to 8-12 words</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Provide Information As Needed</strong> [maps to Curious]</h3>
    <p>Keep information given pertinent to the particular point in the user’s journey. Avoid providing information not immediately important within the context.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not list performance statistics in feature descriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Communicate Confidently / Be Assertive</strong> [maps to Curious]</h3>
    <p>Use a confident and clear tone that leaves no doubt in the user journey. Guide from a place of expertise without talking down to customers. Do not sacrifice a clear message for concise copy.</p>
    <h3><strong>Use a Conversational Tone Without Being Cute</strong> [maps to Principled &#x26; Transparent]</h3>
    <p>Emphasize customer ease and reassurance without resorting to [cutesy] language.</p>
    <h3><strong>Avoid Jargon and Technical Language</strong> [maps to Transparent]</h3>
    <p>Communicate concepts without using jargon. Define acronyms and technical terms. Use metaphors where appropriate.</p>
    <h3><strong>Speak to a Global Audience</strong>[maps to Principled]</h3>
    <p>Use inclusive language. Write at a 7th grade reading level. Don’t make references or use metaphors that only a subset of customers will understand.</p>
    <h3><strong>Be Solutions-Oriented</strong> [maps to Principled &#x26; Curious]</h3>
    <p>Focus on solving problems. Anticipate user problems to write with solutions in mind and embedded in the interface.</p>
    <h3><strong>Prioritize the Customer</strong> [maps to Principled]</h3>
    <p>Center around customer objectives rather than Cloudflare’s business objectives. Write with objective first, then action.</p>
    <h3><strong>Be Clear</strong></h3>
    <p>Make the message clear and comprehensible to the Least Technical User.</p>
    <h3>Internationalization (I18n)</h3>
    <p>Cloudflare has a global customer base. We pride ourself on helping build a better internet everywhere with a network that spans more than 180 cities in 80 countries. To be inclusive of all our customers and make the process of internationalization smoother, we consider certain guidelines for content that is meant to be translated. In addition to all our general product writing guidelines, we also want to ensure that content abides by the following guidelines for localization/translation.</p>
    <p><strong>Write clearly</strong></p>
    <p>An unclear message is difficult to translate, if not impossible. If it is not clear in English, it will not be clear in any other language.</p>
    <p><strong>Avoid cultural references</strong></p>
    <p>Specific cultural references only make sense to the locale you are writing from or a small subset of our customers, so do not use them in product or documentation.</p>
    <p><strong>Do not use contractions</strong></p>
    <p>Even with space constraints, do not use contractions. They are specific to English and often difficult to translate.</p>
    <p><strong>Provide definitions and contextual information</strong></p>
    <p>Never use a technical term or acronym without defining it. Although some terms are not translatable, information and context matter.</p>

    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p>All product content should follow what is outlined in the style guide. Even further, UI components that refer to similar or the same actions across different parts of the dashboard should be perfectly consistent. The following section provides the content that should be included or best practices that should be followed for specific components.</p>
    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>Buttons only directly result in a product action. They are always part of a CTA (call to action).</p>
    <h3>Cards</h3>
    <h4>Title and description</h4>
    <p>Use sentence case for titles. Descriptions should be 2-3 sentences long, with each sentence 15 words or less in length. The description should succinctly describe what the product or feature does. Always start with and focus on the customer objective or benefit.</p>
    <h3>Dropdowns</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the dropdown selection needs to be clearly and directly labeled.</p>
    <p>Always align dropdown content to the left for English and all left-to-right read languages.</p>
    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
    <p>Underline links in text to make it clear it is a link.</p>
    <p>Links external to the dashboard (including other Cloudflare links, like Support resources) should open in a new tab.</p>
    <p>window.open (‘link’)</p>
    <p>Do not say “click here.” Attach the link to relevant keywords, with no more than 3 consecutive words for a link.</p>
    <p>Good:</p>
    <p>Bad:</p>
    <h3>Modals</h3>
    <p>Modals disrupt user flow. They force the user to stop and pay attention to the content in the modal. The content should be scannable and easy to read.</p>
    <p>Good:</p>
    <p>Bad:</p>
    <h4>Dialogs</h4>
    <p>Like any modal, only use a dialog where it is absolutely necessary. Dialogs are specifically used to confirm an irreversible user action or an action with important implications.</p>
    <p>The dialog’s purpose should be in the title with a direct statement or question.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <p>Form fields and sections that require customer input.</p>
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Only use notifications for immediately necessary information, confirmation of an action, or notice of an error.</p>
    <h4>Error</h4>
    <h4>Warning</h4>
    <h4>Success</h4>
    <h4>Info</h4>
    <h3>Selection options</h3>
    <h4>Checkboxes / radio buttons / etc.</h4>
    <p>Options or option descriptions should be limited to 5 words or less</p>
    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <h3>Toast Messages</h3>
    <p>Successful, Failed, Advisory</p>
    <h3>Toggles</h3>
    <p>Always use labels to indicate toggle state. Do not rely solely on color. prevent confusion.</p>
    <p>For toggles that enable or turn on a feature, use the labels <strong>On</strong> and <strong>Off</strong>.</p>
    <p>[need consistency around ‘enable’ or ‘turn on’]</p>
    <p>Good: On</p>
    <p>Bad: Enabled</p>
    <p>Tooltips</p>
    <h3>Zero and error states</h3>
    <p>Other Components:</p>
    <p>Charts - Legends</p>
    <p>Pagination</p>
    <p>Number ranges</p>
    <p>Ordinal - Labels</p>
    <p>Banner</p>
    <p>Loading Delay</p>
    <p>Arrow Swivel content</p>
