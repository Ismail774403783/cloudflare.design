    <h1>Voice and Tone</h1>
    <p>We are driven by our mission to help build a better internet. This means empowering our customers to control the security and performance of their sites with the products we offer.</p>
    <p>Brand Voice Principles</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Principled</li>
      <li>Curious</li>
      <li>Transparent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our voice stays the same across all customer-facing channels. However, our tone varies with context. The following section details how our brand voice adapts to product content.</p>

    <h3>Principled</h3>
    <p>We are mission-driven, through and through. With an ambitious goal, we are focused on delivering with purpose. We speak to a global audience to drive innovation across the entire internet.</p>
    <h3>Curious</h3>
    <p>We communicate technical information in a way that users from all levels of expertise can understand. We understand that while our developers may be experts, not all customers are. We share our technical expertise appropriately with those who want it. We aim to bring our technical smarts and innovations to everyone.</p>
    <h3>Transparent</h3>
    <p>We make our information accessible and useful to all. We always explain complex topics in simple terms without talking down to customers. We are concise and direct so our customers can get to what is important, but we prioritize a clear message over concise copy.</p>
    <h2>Our Customers</h2>
    <p>The primary users on the dashboard are self-serve customers (Free, Pro, Business plans), but Enterprise customers use the dashboard as well. This means our customers come from a wide variety of technical levels, and it is our responsibility to cater to all of them. The simplest way to do this is to use the “Least Technical User” as a baseline and build from there. The dashboard should be simple enough for the Least Technical User to understand but still customizable and stackable for those with advanced technical ability/knowledge, like Workers. Our products are made to be used by everyone.</p>
    <p>Least Technical User</p>
    <p>We use a number of criteria to define our Least Technical User. We have a baseline customer we cater to, and it applies across all plan levels. The plan a customer is on is not an indication of their technical level and should not change the ease-of-use on the dashboard. However, we created user personas for what the Least Technical User might look like on each plan. This provides more context for the type of user you should keep in mind when writing for the dashboard.</p>
    <p>Free/Pro plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No technical background, using Cloudflare for their personal blog</li>
      <li>Primarily use the KB for support/help</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Business plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some or limited technical background</li>
      <li>Using CF for their business because they know it protects online presence and makes site faster for customers</li>
      <li>Use KB and CSUP for support/help</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enterprise plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited to no technical knowledge</li>
      <li>In charge of web services for their company; know who to go to (ie. Cloudflare) but now what?</li>
      <li>Rely on SEs and Support to execute and our teams to convince them of what they need more of</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We assume our customers do not have technical background because we are the experts. However, we also know some of our customers have technical expertise and would like to have more control over the configurations on the dashboard. We aim to provide the technical content these customers want. More technical customers can easily access more technical capabilities and information with the API and developer documentation.</p>
    <p>It is important to keep in mind that technical customers still value ease-of-use. Customers with the ability to use the API and go in-depth into our products should know where to go and how to get started. The path to more technical capabilities on the dashboard should still follow product content writing guidelines.</p>
    <p>Always refer to customers as a customer on the dashboard, not a user.</p>
