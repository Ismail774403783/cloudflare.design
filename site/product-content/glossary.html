    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <h1>Voice and Tone</h1>
    <p>We are driven by our mission to help build a better internet. This means empowering our customers to control the security and performance of their sites with the products we offer.</p>
    <p>Brand Voice Principles</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Principled</li>
      <li>Curious</li>
      <li>Transparent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our voice stays the same across all customer-facing channels. However, our tone varies with context. The following section details how our brand voice adapts to product content.</p>

        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Principled</h3>
    <p>We are mission-driven, through and through. With an ambitious goal, we are focused on delivering with purpose. We speak to a global audience to drive innovation across the entire internet.</p>
    <h3>Curious</h3>
    <p>We communicate technical information in a way that users from all levels of expertise can understand. We understand that while our developers may be experts, not all customers are. We share our technical expertise appropriately with those who want it. We aim to bring our technical smarts and innovations to everyone.</p>
    <h3>Transparent</h3>
    <p>We make our information accessible and useful to all. We always explain complex topics in simple terms without talking down to customers. We are concise and direct so our customers can get to what is important, but we prioritize a clear message over concise copy.</p>
    <h2>Our Customers</h2>
    <p>The primary users on the dashboard are self-serve customers (Free, Pro, Business plans), but Enterprise customers use the dashboard as well. This means our customers come from a wide variety of technical levels, and it is our responsibility to cater to all of them. The simplest way to do this is to use the “Least Technical User” as a baseline and build from there. The dashboard should be simple enough for the Least Technical User to understand but still customizable and stackable for those with advanced technical ability/knowledge, like Workers. Our products are made to be used by everyone.</p>
    <p>Least Technical User</p>
    <p>We use a number of criteria to define our Least Technical User. We have a baseline customer we cater to, and it applies across all plan levels. The plan a customer is on is not an indication of their technical level and should not change the ease-of-use on the dashboard. However, we created user personas for what the Least Technical User might look like on each plan. This provides more context for the type of user you should keep in mind when writing for the dashboard.</p>
    <p>Free/Pro plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No technical background, using Cloudflare for their personal blog</li>
      <li>Primarily use the KB for support/help</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Business plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some or limited technical background</li>
      <li>Using CF for their business because they know it protects online presence and makes site faster for customers</li>
      <li>Use KB and CSUP for support/help</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enterprise plan:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Limited to no technical knowledge</li>
      <li>In charge of web services for their company; know who to go to (ie. Cloudflare) but now what?</li>
      <li>Rely on SEs and Support to execute and our teams to convince them of what they need more of</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We assume our customers do not have technical background because we are the experts. However, we also know some of our customers have technical expertise and would like to have more control over the configurations on the dashboard. We aim to provide the technical content these customers want. More technical customers can easily access more technical capabilities and information with the API and developer documentation.</p>
    <p>It is important to keep in mind that technical customers still value ease-of-use. Customers with the ability to use the API and go in-depth into our products should know where to go and how to get started. The path to more technical capabilities on the dashboard should still follow product content writing guidelines.</p>
    <p>Always refer to customers as a customer on the dashboard, not a user.</p>
    <p>Mru’s research: “Plan type not a reliable proxy for technical proficiency.”</p>

    <h1>Product Writing Guidelines</h1>
    <p>Like any of our content, product content reflects our brand voice. Product content also serves user interfaces. These guidelines uphold Cloudflare’s voice and emphasize ease-of-use within our products.</p>
    <p>The tone we use varies based on what customers want and feel while using certain products and features.</p>
    <p>[not in order of importance yet]</p>
    <h3><strong>Be Concise</strong>[maps to Transparent]</h3>
    <p>Respect our customers’ time. Get to the point, so they can get to what they need. Edit ruthlessly.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keep sentences to 8-12 words</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Provide Information As Needed</strong> [maps to Curious]</h3>
    <p>Keep information given pertinent to the particular point in the user’s journey. Avoid providing information not immediately important within the context.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not list performance statistics in feature descriptions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Communicate Confidently / Be Assertive</strong> [maps to Curious]</h3>
    <p>Use a confident and clear tone that leaves no doubt in the user journey. Guide from a place of expertise without talking down to customers. Do not sacrifice a clear message for concise copy.</p>
    <h3><strong>Use a Conversational Tone Without Being Cute</strong> [maps to Principled &#x26; Transparent]</h3>
    <p>Emphasize customer ease and reassurance without resorting to [cutesy] language.</p>
    <h3><strong>Avoid Jargon and Technical Language</strong> [maps to Transparent]</h3>
    <p>Communicate concepts without using jargon. Define acronyms and technical terms. Use metaphors where appropriate.</p>
    <h3><strong>Speak to a Global Audience</strong>[maps to Principled]</h3>
    <p>Use inclusive language. Write at a 7th grade reading level. Don’t make references or use metaphors that only a subset of customers will understand.</p>
    <h3><strong>Be Solutions-Oriented</strong> [maps to Principled &#x26; Curious]</h3>
    <p>Focus on solving problems. Anticipate user problems to write with solutions in mind and embedded in the interface.</p>
    <h3><strong>Prioritize the Customer</strong> [maps to Principled]</h3>
    <p>Center around customer objectives rather than Cloudflare’s business objectives. Write with objective first, then action.</p>
    <h3><strong>Be Clear</strong></h3>
    <p>Make the message clear and comprehensible to the Least Technical User.</p>
    <h3>Internationalization (I18n)</h3>
    <p>Cloudflare has a global customer base. We pride ourself on helping build a better internet everywhere with a network that spans more than 180 cities in 80 countries. To be inclusive of all our customers and make the process of internationalization smoother, we consider certain guidelines for content that is meant to be translated. In addition to all our general product writing guidelines, we also want to ensure that content abides by the following guidelines for localization/translation.</p>
    <p><strong>Write clearly</strong></p>
    <p>An unclear message is difficult to translate, if not impossible. If it is not clear in English, it will not be clear in any other language.</p>
    <p><strong>Avoid cultural references</strong></p>
    <p>Specific cultural references only make sense to the locale you are writing from or a small subset of our customers, so do not use them in product or documentation.</p>
    <p><strong>Do not use contractions</strong></p>
    <p>Even with space constraints, do not use contractions. They are specific to English and often difficult to translate.</p>
    <p><strong>Provide definitions and contextual information</strong></p>
    <p>Never use a technical term or acronym without defining it. Although some terms are not translatable, information and context matter.</p>

    <p>Including this is going to be a longer process of creating definitions and best practices based on stakeholders for certain terms and names, like PMs and Support.</p>
    <h3>Acronyms</h3>
    <p>Define an acronym the first time you use it on each page. Some acronyms, however, are so widely used that they do not need to be defined. See the <a href="#bookmark=kix.o8jtv91ka6bj">word list</a> for specific acronyms and definitions.</p>
    <p>Never use a technical or Cloudflare acronym without defining it the first time you use it. Customers don’t use every product or feature, so they may not see it elsewhere.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2>Grammar</h2>
    <h3>Verb Tense</h3>
    <p>Use present tense in product descriptions. Only use future tense to describe actions that are</p>
    <p>Avoid using adverbs. Replace them with strong, specific, actionable verbs wherever possible.</p>
    <h3>Active and Passive Voice</h3>
    <p>Use active voice. Avoid passive voice.</p>
    <h3>Nouns and Pronouns</h3>
    <p>Refer to the customer in the second person. Where this is not possible, use gender neutral pronouns.</p>
    <p>Make sure it is clear who/what pronouns are in reference to. Pronouns act as signposts to the subject of the sentence and should not be used incessantly to the point where the subject is no longer clear.</p>
    <h3>Punctuation</h3>
    <h4>Exclamation marks</h4>
    <p>Avoid use of exclamation points, except for Success notifications. In that case, use only one exclamation mark.</p>
    <h4>Quotation marks</h4>
    <p>Avoid quotations marks in product content. Don’t put clickable actions in quotation marks. See <strong><a href="#bookmark=kix.z7r25goptsa5">Bold and italics</a></strong>.</p>
    <h4>Semicolons</h4>
    <p>Avoid semicolons. Instead, break content up into shorter sentences without repeating information. See</p>
    <p><a href="#sentence-length">Sentence length</a> for guidelines.</p>
    <h4>Periods</h4>
    <p>Only use periods at the ends of complete sentences.</p>
    <h4>Commas</h4>
    <p>Use the Oxford comma in lists of 3 or more items in a sentence.</p>
    <p>Use commas to separate clauses. See</p>
    <p><a href="#sentence-length">Sentence length</a> about formatting and breaking up long sentences.</p>
    <h2>Style and Formatting</h2>
    <h3>Capitalization</h3>
    <p>Use sentence case for headings: capitalize the first word and any proper nouns. Use lower case for all other words.</p>
    <h3>Sentence length {#sentence-length}</h3>
    <p>Sentences in product descriptions should not exceed 15 words.</p>
    <p>Elsewhere on the dashboard, keep sentences 8-12 words long. Break up longer sentences into shorter pieces. Keep only what is necessary to convey the message.</p>
    <h3>Contractions</h3>
    <p>Avoid any and all contractions. English contractions are difficult to translate. Even with space constraints, find a different way to convey the message concisely.</p>
    <h3>Slang</h3>
    <p>Avoid all slang, especially derogatory or vulgar language.</p>
    <h3><strong>Bold</strong> and <em>italics</em></h3>
    <p>Use <strong>bold</strong> when referring to a clickable action, like buttons.</p>
    <p>Use <em>italics</em> when referring to an option that customers can select from, like in dropdowns.</p>
    <p>Examples</p>
    <h3>Numbers</h3>
    <p>Use numerals for numbers. Spell it out if the number begins a sentence.</p>
    <p>Put commas in numbers with more than 3 digits (no spaces).</p>
    <ul>
      <li>300</li>
      <li>1,000</li>
      <li>7,465</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Dates</h4>
    <p>Always write out the day and month. Different regions of the world use different numerical date formats, so writing it out keeps the date clear.</p>
    <p>Good: May 17, 2019</p>
    <p>Bad: 05-17-19, 05-17-2019, 17-05-19</p>
    <p>Abbreviate the days and months only if space is limited. Use periods for these abbreviations.</p>
    <p>Sep. 15, 2018 for September 15, 2018</p>
    <p>Mon. for Monday</p>
    <h4>Time</h4>
    <p>Use 24-hour (military) time.</p>
    <h4>Percentages</h4>
    <p>Use the % symbol in lieu of “percent.”</p>
    <h4>Units of measure</h4>
    <p>Include a space between a numerical value and the corresponding unit of measurement.</p>
    <p>Good: 5 GB</p>
    <p>Bad: 5GB</p>
    <h2>Components</h2>
    <p>All product content should follow what is outlined in the style guide. Even further, UI components that refer to similar or the same actions across different parts of the dashboard should be perfectly consistent. The following section provides the content that should be included or best practices that should be followed for specific components.</p>
    <h3>Buttons</h3>
    <p>Buttons only directly result in a product action. They are always part of a CTA (call to action).</p>
    <h3>Cards</h3>
    <h4>Title and description</h4>
    <p>Use sentence case for titles. Descriptions should be 2-3 sentences long, with each sentence 15 words or less in length. The description should succinctly describe what the product or feature does. Always start with and focus on the customer objective or benefit.</p>
    <h3>Dropdowns</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the dropdown selection needs to be clearly and directly labeled.</p>
    <p>Always align dropdown content to the left for English and all left-to-right read languages.</p>
    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
    <p>Underline links in text to make it clear it is a link.</p>
    <p>Links external to the dashboard (including other Cloudflare links, like Support resources) should open in a new tab.</p>
    <p>window.open (‘link’)</p>
    <p>Do not say “click here.” Attach the link to relevant keywords, with no more than 3 consecutive words for a link.</p>
    <p>Good:</p>
    <p>Bad:</p>
    <h3>Modals</h3>
    <p>Modals disrupt user flow. They force the user to stop and pay attention to the content in the modal. The content should be scannable and easy to read.</p>
    <p>Good:</p>
    <p>Bad:</p>
    <h4>Dialogs</h4>
    <p>Like any modal, only use a dialog where it is absolutely necessary. Dialogs are specifically used to confirm an irreversible user action or an action with important implications.</p>
    <p>The dialog’s purpose should be in the title with a direct statement or question.</p>
    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <p>Form fields and sections that require customer input.</p>
    <h3>Notifications</h3>
    <p>Only use notifications for immediately necessary information, confirmation of an action, or notice of an error.</p>
    <h4>Error</h4>
    <h4>Warning</h4>
    <h4>Success</h4>
    <h4>Info</h4>
    <h3>Selection options</h3>
    <h4>Checkboxes / radio buttons / etc.</h4>
    <p>Options or option descriptions should be limited to 5 words or less</p>
    <h3>Tables</h3>
    <h3>Toast Messages</h3>
    <p>Successful, Failed, Advisory</p>
    <h3>Toggles</h3>
    <p>Always use labels to indicate toggle state. Do not rely solely on color. prevent confusion.</p>
    <p>For toggles that enable or turn on a feature, use the labels <strong>On</strong> and <strong>Off</strong>.</p>
    <p>[need consistency around ‘enable’ or ‘turn on’]</p>
    <p>Good: On</p>
    <p>Bad: Enabled</p>
